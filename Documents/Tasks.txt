Write lastJulianCoords(calendar, timezone, frame) - midnight of the next day in wall
Write firstGregorianCoords - midnight of the day
Any functions that use the above 2 that are in UlimateDatetime need to move to LocalDatetime
Integrate the above, replacing calls to lastJulianDay and firstGregorianDay, respectively
Revisit offsetLocalCalCoords and offsetLocalCalCoordsDT as far as calendar manipulation
Treat UTCDatetime as all frames of reference are equal
Write the comparison functions for uncertain datatypes
Integrate the above into Julia using the operators in the Comparison operators for values with uncertainties spreadsheet
Add precision, uncertainty and ticks to LocalCalCoordsDT - needed to process uncertainty comparisons
Finish LocalDatetime
